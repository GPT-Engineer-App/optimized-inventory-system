        Track product variants (size, color, etc.)
    Inventory Tracking:
        Real-time inventory levels for all products across locations (if applicable)
        Low stock alerts and reorder point notifications
        Track inventory movement (inflow, outflow, adjustments)
    Ordering & Receiving:
        Generate purchase orders based on reorder points and demand forecasts
        Manage supplier information and track order status
        Efficient receiving process with barcode scanning and product verification
